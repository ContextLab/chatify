A python package that enables ipython magic commands to Jupyter notebooks that provide LLM-driven enhancements to markdown and code cells.

# How to get started

Welcome!  This is a new project (in the "concept" phase) and we're looking for help!  If you're new around here and want to explore/contribute, here's how:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/ContextLab/chatify/fork) this repository so that you can work with your own "copy" of the code base
2. Take a look at our [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/ContextLab/projects/3) and/or the list of open [issues](https://github.com/ContextLab/chatify/issues) to get a sense of the current project status, todo list, etc.
3. Feel free to add your own issues/tasks, comment on existing issues, etc.

## Current priorities and suggested tasks to start with

In general, we've broken down tasks into ["coding" tasks](https://github.com/ContextLab/chatify/labels/coding%20required) (which require some amount of coding, likely in Python) and ["non-coding" tasks](https://github.com/ContextLab/chatify/labels/non-coding) (which do *not* require coding).

If you have questions, ideas, etc., also please check out the [discussion board](https://github.com/ContextLab/chatify/discussions)!
